# BB_Tours-Travels_Website
During my graduation tenure I had made this website alongwith my friend as a part of miniproject.
The BB in the website name stands for 'Bharat Bhraman' Tours and Travels, a unique identified name for personal use.
The website was created using web development languages like  HTML 5 , CSS.
Website covers designed webpages as-
1.	Register a new User.
2.	User can login to the website on prior successful registration.
3.	Website shows various places across India for travelling which the user would want to travel.
4.	It should have all the booking options for the user to book the tickets.
#Attached documents contain the website itself, technical report of the designed website.
